Interview Questions
===================

Interviewing candidates is really hard! Here's what I look for, and what questions I have found work well.

Growth Mindset
--------------

Is the candidate aware of their strengths and weaknesses, and are they continually looking for ways to grow and improve?

* Tell me about your current position.
  * What is your role within your team?
  * What is your key contribution?
* What are you looking for in your new position?
  * What gaps in your skillset would you like to fill?
  * Most candidates focus on _technical_ skills â€“ what about "non-technical" skills?
    * Communication, mentorship, project management, etc.
* Why _<company they are applying for>_?
  * Is this the place where you will keep growing? Why?
