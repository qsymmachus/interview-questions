Interview Questions
===================

Interviewing candidates is really hard! Here's what I look for, and what questions I have found work well.

Growth Mindset
--------------

Is the candidate aware of their strengths and weaknesses, and are they continually looking for ways to grow and improve?

* Tell me about your current position.
  * What is your role within your team?
  * What is your key contribution?
* What are you looking for in your new position?
  * What gaps in your skillset would you like to fill?
  * Most candidates focus on _technical_ skills – what about "non-technical" skills?
    * Communication, mentorship, project management, etc.
* Why join our team?
  * Is this the place where you will keep growing? Why?

System Design
-------------

Does the candidate have experience designing an implementing a useful system?

* Pick a project or system you worked on recently, and walk me through its design.
  * Candidate should aim for breadth and depth – let them deep-dive where they seem strongest.
  * What was the system designed to do, and how did you implement it?
  * How do you monitor the system?
  * What are its failure modes?
  * In retrospect, what would you have designed differently?

Development Process
-------------------

Good software engineers understand that success depends on more than just code. Can the candidate collaborate, prioritize effectively, and minimize risk while maximizing flexibility?

* Pick a project you worked on recently (it can be the same project covered in the system design question). Walk me through its development process.
  * What was the problem you were trying to solve?
  * _Why_ were you solving that problem?
  * What features did you decide _not_ to include?
  * What were some of the big decisions that had to be made?
    * Were there disagreements? Why? How did you resolve them?
  * How did you decide to sequence development?
  * How did you measure progress?
  * How well were you able to anticipate future needs?
